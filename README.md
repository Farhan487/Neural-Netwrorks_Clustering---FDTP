# Neural-Netwrorks_Clustering---FDTP


📌 Overview
This project predicts whether food deliveries will be "Fast" or "Delayed" using machine learning. It analyzes delivery patterns with clustering and builds a neural network classifier.

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.8+

Required packages:

bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
🚀 How to Run
Place your Food_Delivery_Time_Prediction.csv in the project folder

Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script

Results will show:

Optimal number of clusters

Neural network performance metrics

Visualizations of delivery patterns

🔍 Key Features
Clustering Analysis: Identifies delivery patterns using K-Means

Neural Network: Predicts fast/delayed deliveries with 85%+ accuracy

Visualizations: Includes plots of delivery clusters and model performance

📊 Results
Classification report with precision/recall metrics
